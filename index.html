    <h1>Switzerland</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>A landlocked country of towering mountains, deep Alpine lakes, grassy valleys dotted with neat farms and small
      villages, and thriving cities that blend the old and the new, Switzerland is the nexus of the diverse physical and
      cultural geography of western Europe, renowned for both its natural beauty and its way of life. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mountains">
    <p>The main reason why Switzerland is the perfect vacation for me are the Alps. Hiking mountains is my favorite
      hobby, and this small but rugged country has the best mountains and peaks. These amazing mountains are also home
      to the world's top ski resorts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chocolate">
    <p>CHOCOLATES. I love chocolates so much, and Swiss chocolates are world class. Switzerland is arguably best known
      for its milk chocolate, with milk chocolate making up 80% of all chocolate consumed in Switzerland, and for good
      reason! Swiss chocolate contains more milk than most chocolate, offering a distinctly smooth and creamy flavour
      and texture you won't find elsewhere.</p>
